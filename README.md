# Community-Health-Dashboard

This is a project I develop as part of the Data Science Bootcamp at the NYC Data Science Academy. 
Using the data from CDC's 500 Cities Project and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid hosptial overall rating, 
I designed a visualization tool to help city officials, public health agencies, and hospitals to develop effective 
strategies to improve community health. The link to the interactive tool could be found here:
